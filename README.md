This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a catch-all route (`*`) can conflict with other routes, especially when nested routes are involved. The `App.js` file shows the buggy code, where the catch-all route unexpectedly intercepts requests intended for other routes. The `AppSolution.js` provides a corrected version, ensuring that the catch-all route only handles true 404 scenarios.
